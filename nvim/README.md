You should probably install the following:
## Clones
* packer: This isn't bootstrapped in like most configs, so you'll have to install it via `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim`
## PIP
* pynvim: Gets rid of those pesky errors about not being able to load Python packages
## APT
* fd: Dependency
* ripgerp: Dependency
* xclip: Allows you to copy/paste to the system clipboard within neovim. Not needed (and apparently should be avoided) on WSL.
