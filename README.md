# dotfiles
These are a collection of my dotfiles used on my Linux machines.

## Dumb Installation
### Vim (.vimrc)
* Place the file in your home directory, for example (~/.vimrc)
* You will also need [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
* Install it with ``git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim``
* Following that, open a new vim session and enter ``:VundleInstall`` to grab the plugins

### NeoVim
* Copy the nvim folder to your ~/.config folder
* You will also need [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
* Install it with ``git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim``
* Following that, open a new nvim session and enter ``:PackerInstall`` to grab the plugins

### Bash (.bashrc)
* Place the file in your home directory, for example (~/.bashrc)

### Git (.gitignore\_global)
* Place the file in your home directory, for example (~/.gitignore\_global)
* Run ``git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore\_global``

### Input (.inputrc)
* Place the file in your home directory, for example (~/.inputrc)

### XFCE Terminal (xfce/terminalrc)
* Place the file in ~/.config/xfce/terminal/terminalrc (Note: Sometimes this folder is called "xfce4" instead of "xfce")

## Smart Installation
* Clone the repository ``git clone https://github.com/taizweb/dotfiles.git``
* Make a symlink of the desired file ``ln -s ~/path/to/dotfiles/.filerc ~/.filerc`` (You may have to look at the Dumb Installation to know where to place the dotfiles, but most go in your home directory).

## Contributing
Don't. Mostly. If I'm doing something terribly wrong in one of my rc files, feel free to make a pull request to amend it. As for suggesting actual changes (like telling me to stop being a heathen and use 8 space indentation) I would prefer you not to.
